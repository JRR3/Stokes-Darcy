# Stokes-Darcy
This is part of my thesis work at 
[Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/science/departments/math-stat/). You can access my thesis

It couples the Darcy and Stokes equations to model a filtration problem. 
The associated publication is: 
[A deposition model coupling Stokes’ and Darcy’s equations with nonlinear deposition](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2018.02.021).
This work is based on some results from the paper 
[Nonlinear Darcy fluid flow with deposition](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2016.06.025).
Most of this work is related to the [Finite Element Method](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387759333).
Some filtration simulations associated to the Nonlinear Darcy problem can be found
